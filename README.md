Overview:
In this challenge we are introduced to sql which is one of the more effiectnt ways of coming through data. the purpose
 of this chhallenge is to take a database of employees and look through it and determine who is elligible for retirement
 and which employees are elligible for the mentorship program. The most important thing was to determine how many peple minght retire
 in the near future
 
 Results:
 In this analysis we were able to find that that a lot of employees are getting to the retirement age and we can infer a 
 lot of spots will open up in the near future. From the count of senior people we can see that they are a majority of the workforce
 and it is in the companies best intrest to considar replacing people that will leave later.

 Conclusion:
 With over 57,000 employees eleigble for retirement that is equal to 60% of your workforce leaving very soon
 As far as mentors are concerded there are over 50,000 people eligible to be a mentor so they do have the staff numbers
 to lead the next generation of workers and eventually fill the spots that will be vacant.
